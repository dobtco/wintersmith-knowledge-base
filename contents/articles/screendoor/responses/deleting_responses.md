If you need to remove duplicate or erroneous responses, you can send them to the trash. At any time, you can choose to restore these responses. Or you can  delete them permanently, removing from your project all traces of their data.

### Moving a response to the trash

From your project’s Responses page, use the checkboxes on the left side of the table to select the responses you want to send to the trash. Press the More button above the table, and select Delete from the dropdown.

## F.A.Q.

### How do I block a specific person from submitting to my form?

You can create a shortcut that sends responses from a specific email address to your project’s trash. This will keep them separate from the other responses.

To configure this shortcut, go to your project's Responses page and click "Configure shortcuts" in the lower left-hand corner. Click "Add shortcut." In the dropdown of triggers, select “is submitted by...” Then, enter the email address in the adjacent field. In the dropdown of actions, select “move it to the trash.”
