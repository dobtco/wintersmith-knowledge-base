## Allowing edits to multiple responses

If you'd like your respondents to be able to edit their responses after they have submitted them, click "Allow edits" from the "more" dropdown above the "Responses" table.

You can then allow edits for all respondents ("All"), for the respondents displayed in the current search results ("Current search results"), or for the respondents you have selected by checking the box next to their name in the "Responses" table ("Checked").

After you have chosen which responses to enable for editing, select either "Yes" or "Once" from the "Released for edits" dropdown. "Yes" will enable multiple edits, while "Once" will only allow the respondent to edit their response only one time. Then, click "Update responses" to allow edits. Note that you can always go back and disable response editing by selecting "No" from the "Edit type" dropdown.

## Allowing edits to a specific response

If you just want to allow edits to one response, you can also do so from the individual response page (click the response from the "Responses" table to get to this page). Click the "Allow respondent to edit" link (just below the sidebar) and select the appropriate option from the dropdown.

Once you allow edits, you can copy the edit URL and send it to respondents if necessary. Click "Show edit URL" from the sidebar and copy the edit URL from the modal.
