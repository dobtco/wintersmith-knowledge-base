## Importing responses

To import responses into your project from a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file, select the "Import responses" box on the left-hand side of the "Settings" page for your project. Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted, and that it contains column headers as the first row. Select your CSV file, optionally add a label that will be applied to all imported items, and click the "Import responses" button to import responses from your CSV file.

## I have my data in an Excel file. Can I get it into Screendoor?
Yes! Save your data as a CSV file from Excel. Then you can easily import it into Screendoor (see above).

## Will importing responses automatically create fields in my Screendoor form?
If the "Automatically add response fields that don't exist" checkbox is left checked (recommended), Screendoor will add a new response field to your project for every column header in your CSV file that does not correspond to a pre-existing response field. For example, if your CSV file includes a column header `favorite color` that does not already exist in your project, the `favorite color` field will be added to your project as a new response field. You will be able to edit this new field in the form builder and new responses will be able to include information about the responder's favorite color.
