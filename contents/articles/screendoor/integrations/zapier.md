Zapier is a product that allows you to automate your workflow by providing a connecting bridge between a variety of apps and service. If you have a Zapier account, you can use Screendoor's triggers to add great integrations with the [apps](https://zapier.com/zapbook/) your team uses regularly.

For example, the DOBT team onboards new employees with a Screendoor form. Once they have submitted their form, we use Zapier to post a welcome mesage to [Slack](http://www.slack.com):

### Connecting Screendoor to Zapier

Before you get started, make sure you have [permission](/articles/your_account/accounts/managing_users.html#managing-user-permissions) to manage Screendoor's API keys. Click on your avatar in the navigation bar, and select &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; from the dropdown.

If you can see &ldquo;API keys&rdquo; as an option in the sidebar, your first step is to create an API key that Zapier can connect to screendoor with. Create an API key with a name of &ldquo;Zapier&rdquo;, and copy it.

If you can't find an API keys page on Screendoor, ask your account administrator to give you the proper permissions.

Because Screendoor is not publicly listed as a Zapier application, you'll need to accept our invitation. Press the button below to do so.

Enter a name for your own reference (this could just be &ldquo;Screendoor&rdquo;). Under &ldquo;API key&rdquo;, paste in the key you generated earlier.

Zapier will test your API key to make sure it's working. If you receive an authorization error, make sure you entered the API key correctly.


### Using Zapier with Screendoor

Any Screendoor zap you create needs to be connected to a specific project. In the process of creating a zap, Zapier will ask you for your Screendoor project's ID.

You can find your project ID on its Settings page, under &ldquo;General settings&rdquo;. Click the &ldquo;Show advanced settings&rdquo; link, and scroll to the bottom.
