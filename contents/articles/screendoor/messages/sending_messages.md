## Sending messages to all your respondents

If you'd like to send a message to all your respondents, just click "Write message" from the "More" dropdown above the "Responses" table.

![write message](../images/write_message.png)

Make sure the "All" checkbox is selected, and then click the "Craft your message" button.

![write message popup](../images/write_message_popup.png)

Enter a reply-to email, a subject, and write your message!

- Tip: You can also insert a variety of useful respondent-specific variables (for example, the respondent's name) by clicking the curly braces icon and selecting the variable you would like to insert. ![](../images/insert_merge_variable.png)

Then, click "Preview" to make sure everything looks good. Click "Send messages" to send your message to all your respondents.

## Sending messages to specific respondents

If you'd prefer to send a message only to specific respondents, just check the box next to those respondents from the "Responses" table and select the "Checked" checkbox from the "Send a messge" popup.

Alternatively, you can apply some [filters](../responses/sorting_and_filtering_responses.html) before clicking "Write message." Then, select the "Current search results" checkbox from the "Send a message" popup.

## Reviewing sent messages

You can review all the messages you've sent by clicking the "Messages" link for your project. Click the "View sent message" button to review a previously sent message. Note that this is a new feature, and that there may not be records for older messages.

## Message presets

To use message presets, which allow you to quickly send canned replies to your respondents, check out the [Message presets](presets.html) article.
