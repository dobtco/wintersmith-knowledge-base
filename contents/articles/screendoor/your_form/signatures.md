If you need your forms to be signed before they are submitted, Screendoor lets you add electronic signatures to any form.

<div class='alert'>
    **Note**: In order to use electronic signatures, you'll need to sign up for a Standard plan or higher.

### Getting started

Select the &ldquo;Edit project&rdquo; link on the right side of the project header, and choose &ldquo;Signature and fees&rdquo; from the Progress menu.  

To add electronic signatures to your project, check the box &ldquo;Ask users to sign the form before submitting.&rdquo;

Now when respondents fill out your form, they will now be required to sign their response before submitting it.

### Viewing a signature

When a response is signed, you can view their signature from that response's page. Go to your project's Responses page, and click on a response in the table. The signature should be displayed in the sidebar on the right-hand side.

### Requesting a new signature

Screendoor binds each signature to a single revision of a response. If you, the respondent, or a collaborator edits a response, it will need to be signed again.

When a response is edited, the signature status in the sidebar changes accordingly.

To send an email asking the respondent to sign the new revision, click the &ldquo;Request new signature&rdquo; link.

After they sign the response, the new signature will display in the sidebar. You can still view their old signatures by viewing a previous revision of the response.

To quickly view which responses in your project still need signature, press the &ldquo;Edit columns&rdquo; button on the Responses page, and display the &ldquo;Signed?&ldquo; column.

Click on the column's header to sort unsigned responses to the top of the table.
