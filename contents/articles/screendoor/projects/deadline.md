To configure response preferences for your project, click "Edit project" and select "Responses" from the "Progress" menu.

## Adding a response due date

Set a deadline for responses by selecting a date (and time) from the date/time picker.

![set due date](../images/response_due_date.png)

If you need to extend the due date, simply return to this page and select a new date (You can also [extend the due date for a specific response](../responses/providing_support_to_respondents.html#extending-the-due-date-for-a-specific-response)). To clear the due date and allow all responses, click the "Clear due date" link.

### Adding a grace period

To add a grace period, click "Add grace period" and select a date from the date/time picker. After the response due date has passed but before the grace period ends, respondents will be able to submit their pre-existing drafts but will not be able to create new responses.

## F.A.Q.

### What time zone will the response due date be set in?
The response due date will be set in your current local time zone. The date/time will automatically be presented to users based on their own local time zone. For example, if you set the due date to 4:00pm and you are in the Pacific Time Zone, users on the East Coast will see the due date as 7:00pm.
