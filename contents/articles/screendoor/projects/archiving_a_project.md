If you exceed the number of projects your plan allows, you can archive an inactive project to keep your data safe. Archived projects don't count towards your plan's limits, because they're read-only: you can't change an archived project's settings, add ratings and comments, or accept new submissions.

To archive a project, visit your project's Settings page, and select "Archive project" in the bottom left-hand corner.

Archived projects have a tag next to their title, to remind you of its status. If you want to restore an archived project, just press the "Restore project" button on the alert at the top of the page.

### F.A.Q.

#### Will my project page still be visible if my project is archived?
Archived projects will *not* show up on your organization's project listing page. However, if someone still has the URL for your project page, they will be able to view it (but not submit responses).
