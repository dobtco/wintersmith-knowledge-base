Depending on your plan, Screendoor will limit the following items:

| Item  | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Projects | At any given time, you are allowed to have the number of active projects allotted towards your plan. [Archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) do not count towards this limit. |
| Collaborators | You are allowed to have the number of [collaborators](../collaboration/collaborators.html) allotted to your plan at any given time. If someone in your organization collaborates on multiple projects, they will only count as one collaborator. Collaborators for [archived projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) are not counted. |

Once you have reached the maximum amount of projects or collaborators, you won't be able to add more of them, until you upgrade your plan, [remove collaborators](/articles/screendoor/collaboration/collaborators.html#removing-collaborators), or [archive some projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html). 

In addition, [e-signatures](../your_form/signatures.html), [teams](../collaboration/teams.html) and [Socrata sync](../integrations/socrata.html) are only available for advanced plans. See our [pricing page](http://www.dobt.co/screendoor/pricing/) for more information.
