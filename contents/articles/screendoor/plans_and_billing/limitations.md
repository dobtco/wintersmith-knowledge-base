title: Plan limits
order: 1
---

Depending on your plan, Screendoor will limit the following items:

| Item  | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Projects | You're allowed to have this number of active projects at any given time. Archived projects do not count towards this limit. |
| Collaborators | You're allowed to have this number of active [collaborators](../projects/collaborators.html) at any given time. If someone collaborates on multiple projects within your organization, they will only count as one collaborator. Collaborators for archived projects are not counted. |

Once your plan's limit for a certain feature has been reached (for example, you've maxed out on projects), you won't be able to add any more unless you upgrade your plan or remove some. Remember, you can [archive inactive projects](/articles/screendoor/projects/archiving_a_project.html) so that they don't count towards your project limit.

In addition, some advanced features are only available on certain plans:

- [Electronic signatures](../your_form/signatures.html)
- [Project teams](../projects/teams.html)
- [Socrata data sync](../integrations/socrata.html)

See our [pricing page](http://www.dobt.co/screendoor/pricing/) for more information.
