title: Advanced evaluation settings
---

To enable the advanced evaluation settings, check the box under "Advanced evaluations."

![advanced evaluations box](../images/screenshot_advanced_evaluation.png)

Once you check this box, a new "Advanced Evaluation" section should show up in the "Project checklist" just under "Evaluation." From the "Advanced Evaluation" page, you can configure several advanced evaluation settings.

## Rating field weights

You can define a weight (also known as a multiplier) for your rating fields. For example, if you wanted to weigh "Excellence" more heavily than "Originality," you could configure your rating fields accordingly:

If we then rate a response's originality at 5 (out of 10) and its excellence at 10 (out of 10), we will get an average rating of 80% (rather than 75%, as it would be without any weighting). To see details about a weighted rating, simply click the link under "Average rating" on the right-hand side of an individual response page.

From this ratings page, you'll see a breakdown of how Screendoor calculates weighted ratings.

## Rating scale

You can optionally configure a label for each rating number in order to specify what that number designates.

When evaluators rate responses, these labels will show up next to their numbers on the response page.

## Rating deadlines

You can also optionally configure a date when evaluators will be able to begin rating responses. This can be useful if you want to make sure that evaluators do not rate responses until they have been completed. If you set a date, but then later decide that you want to allow ratings immediately, simply click the "Allow ratings immediately" link.

If you want to make sure that evaluators submit their ratings by a specific date, you can set up an optional ratings due date by selecting the appropriate date and time from the date picker. If you later decide to remove the due date, just click the "No due date" link.
