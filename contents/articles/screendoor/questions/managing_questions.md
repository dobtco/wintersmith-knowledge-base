## F.A.Q.

### Can I answer a question privately?
Yes, just uncheck the "Display this question publicly?" box when you answer the question.

### Can I add a question manually?
Yes, just initialize the question yourself by clicking the "Submit question" link from the main project page (get there by clicking the "View project" button). Then, you can answer it normally.
