Adopta is a platform for adopting civic infrastructure (e.g., fire hydrants). As an admin, you can [create and configure](site_admin/configuring_your_site.html) an Adopta map and [populate it with adoptable things](site_admin/adding_adoptable_things.html). Then, anyone can view and adopt these things.
