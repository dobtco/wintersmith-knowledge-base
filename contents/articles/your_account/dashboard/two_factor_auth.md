Make your account more secure by requiring an extra step for authentication. If you have a smartphone, you'll need either the [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) mobile app. If you don't have a smartphone, you can use the [Authy Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authy/gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb).

### Enabling two-factor authentication

To enable two-factor authentication on your DOBT account, visit the ["Your profile" page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/account/). Under "Two-factor authentication," click the "Enable" link.

Next, add an "authenticator account" by pressing the "+" button. Scan the QR code displayed on the ["Enable two-factor authentication" page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/account/two_factor/) or enter the code manually, enter "DOBT" as your account name, and press "Done." Back on the ["Enable two-factor authentication" page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/account/two_factor/), submit the validation code from Authy and click "Verify device."

#### Using the Authy Chrome app

The easiest way to use two-factor authentication without a smartphone is with the Authy Chrome app.

[Download the Authy Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authy/gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb) and set it up by entering your phone number. You will receive an SMS from Authy with your registration code. Enter this code into Authy to register your phone number.

Next, set up a master password for Authy under the "Account" tab.

Now that your Authy account is set up, click "Add Authenticator Account" and enter the code displayed on the ["Enable two-factor authentication" page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/account/two_factor/). (It will be something like `xrijdtj44fdc52tdopxpg6yt`.) Click "Add Account," select a logo, and enter "DOBT" for the account name. You should now see a "DOBT" account under "External Accounts" in Authy.

To finish setting up two-factor authentication for your DOBT account, close the main Authy window. You should then see a smaller Authy window.
