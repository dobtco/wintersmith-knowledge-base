## F.A.Q.

### My password isn't working

If your password isn't working, make sure that you're signing in with the correct email address and confirm that your Caps Lock key is off. If it still isn't working, click the "Forgot?" button to the right of the password field to reset your password.

### I'm having trouble resetting my password

If you tried to reset your password but still have not received the reset email, confirm that you submitted the correct email address. Also, check your spam folder for the reset email. If it's been a while and you still haven't received an email, contact us at [support@dobt.co](mailto:support@dobt.co).
