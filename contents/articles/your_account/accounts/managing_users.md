When you add a user, you can choose the appropriate permission level for that user from the "Permission level" dropdown on the "Invite user" page.

To manage permissions for existing users, click on the user you'd like to manage from the "Users" page. Then, check or uncheck the appropriate permissions under "App permissions."

## Resetting a user's password
