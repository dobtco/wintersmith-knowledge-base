## Signing up

### From an existing organization

If you don't already have a dobt.co account, you'll need to ask an administrator from your organization to invite you. Once they do, you'll be able to create an account by accepting the invite and filling out the basic form.

### With a new organization

If you aren't part of an existing organization, you'll need to [sign up as a new organization](https://dashboard.dobt.co/organizations/new).

## Signing in

If you already have a dobt.co account, you can sign in from the [sign in page](https://dashboard.dobt.co/sign_in). You'll need the email address you signed up with, as well as the password you created.

## Forgot password

If you forgot your password, simply click the question mark on the right side of where you would normally enter your password. Then, follow the prompts to reset your password.

## My password isn't working

If your password isn't working, make sure that you're signing in with the correct email address and double check that caps lock is off. If it still isn't working, click the `Forgot your password?` question mark (see above) to reset your password.

## I'm having trouble resetting my password

If you tried to reset your password but still have not received the reset email, confirm that you sent it to the correct email address and that it didn't get caught in a spam filter. If you still haven't received the reset email after some time has passed, try contacting an administrator from your organization. If you still can't sign in and cannot resolve the issue, [contact us](mailto:support@dobt.co).
