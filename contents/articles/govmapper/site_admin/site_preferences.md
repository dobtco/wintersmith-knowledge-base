### Customizing your site's appearance

To customize your site's appearance, click the "Customize" button under "Appearance." From the live preview page, you can add a logo (which will show up above the map and on the left side of the navigation bar), hide brand text (the "GovMapper" text that shows up above your map), set the navigation bar's background/link color, and even add your own custom CSS.

To use the live preview page, simply make changes on the left-hand side of the page and then click the "Preview" button to view them on the right. Feel free to play around with different options and preview them, as your customizations won't be saved until you hit the "Save and Exit" button.

### Setting a default map location

To set the default location for your map (which is what new users will see when they view your map), simply drag the map under "Default map location" to the appropriate point.
