### Customizing your site's appearance

To customize your site's appearance, click the &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; button under &ldquo;Appearance.&rdquo; From the live preview page, you can add a logo (which will show up above the map and on the left side of the navigation bar), hide brand text (i.e., the &ldquo;GovMapper&rdquo; text that appears above your map), set the navigation bar's background/link color, and even add your own custom CSS.

To use the live preview page, make changes on the left-hand side of the page and then click the &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; button to view them on the right. Feel free to play around with different options and preview them, as your customizations won't be saved until you hit the &ldquo;Save and Exit&rdquo; button.

### Setting a default map location

To set the default location for your map (which is what new users will see when they view your map), drag the map under &ldquo;Default map location&rdquo; to the appropriate point.
