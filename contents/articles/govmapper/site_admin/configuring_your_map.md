To configure your map, click its name from the "Maps" section of GovMapper.

## Configuring your response form

To configure your response form (the form that users will fill out when adding a place), click the "Build your form" link from the "On Screendoor..." sidebar. This will take you to Screendoor's form builder, where you can [build your response form](/articles/screendoor/your_form/building_your_form.html) as you would for any Screendoor project.

![build your form](../images/build_your_form.png)

> **Note**: Data for any response field not marked as "admin only" will be displayed publicly on your map.

## Editing your map's settings

![map settings](../images/map_settings.png)

To change your map's name, edit the name under "Settings."

You can also choose whether your map is displayed by default, which means that new users to your site will not have to [click on your map's name](../public_site/viewing_your_site.html#toggling-map-layers) to see it.

If "Show revision history on the public site" if checked, users to your site will be able to see the same response history that is available to admins on Screendoor.

## Managing permissions

To manage permissions for your map, select a permission level next to the appropriate user group.

![permissions](../images/permissions.png)

You can also set a permission level for individual users after you've added them.

## Adding users

To add a user to your map, start typing their name or email address in the search box under "Add users."

![add users](../images/add_users.png)

If the person you're searching for is already registered on Screendoor and part of your organization, you'll see them come up in your search and can add them immediately. Make sure to select the appropriate permission level from the dropdown.

![add user](../images/add_user.png)

You can also add users who are not yet registered with your organization. Just enter their name and email address, select a permission level, choose whether or not to add them to your organization, and click "Send invite."

![add new user](../images/add_new_user.png)

## Configuring map markers

Choose whether to display a solid color (of your choice) or a custom image as the place marker for your map by selecting either "Solid color" or "Custom image" from the "Marker type" dropdown.

![marker type](../images/marker_type.png)

If you chose "Solid color," you can optionally pick a custom color by clicking the color picker under "Marker color" and selecting a color. This is what the map markers will look like in a solid color:

![markers](../images/markers.png)

If you chose "Custom image," pick your image by clicking "Choose File" and selecting an image to upload.

![custom image](../images/custom_image.png)

Your custom image will be used as the map marker.

> **Note**: Upload at "2x resolution" to ensure your map marker will display correctly on retina displays. For example, if you want your marker to display as 256x256 pixels, upload at a 512x512 resolution.
