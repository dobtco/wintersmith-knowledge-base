To configure your map, click its name from the "Maps" section of GovMapper.

## Changing your map's name

To change your map's name (and the name of the associated Screendoor project), edit the name under "Settings."

## Managing permissions

To manage permissions for your map, select a permission level next to the appropriate user group.

![permissions](../images/permissions.png)

You can also set a permission level for individual users after you've added them.

## Adding users

To add a user to your map, start typing their name or email address in the search box under "Add users."

![add users](../images/add_users.png)

If the person you're searching for is already registered on Screendoor and part of your organization, you'll see them come up in your search and can add them immediately. Make sure to select the appropriate permission level from the dropdown.

![add user](../images/add_user.png)

You can also add users who are not yet registered with your organization. Just enter their name and email address, select a permission level, choose whether or not to add them to your organization, and click "Send invite."

## Configuring map markers

Choose whether to display a solid color (of your choice) or a custom image as the place marker for your map by selecting either "Solid color" or "Custom image" from the "Marker type" dropdown.

![marker type](../images/marker_type.png)

If you chose "Solid color," you can optionally pick a custom color by clicking the color picker under "Marker color" and selecting a color. This is what the map markers will look like in a solid color:

![markers](../images/markers.png)

If you chose "Custom image," pick your image by clicking "Choose File" and selecting an image to upload.

![custom image](../images/custom_image.png)

Your custom image will be used as the map marker.

> Note: Upload at 2x resolution to ensure your map marker will work on retina displays. For example, if your image would normally be 256x256 pixels, upload at a 512x512 resolution.
