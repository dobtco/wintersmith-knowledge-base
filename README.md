## Overall Goals

Our users are largely non-technical, so it will be a good source of info for them. Use cases include:

- Using it to run trainings/self-trainings
- Linking to it when we get support requests
- Linking to it from pages inside of our apps
- Using it as a sales tool: sometimes, instead of giving a demo, we can link folks to the appropriate sections in the knowledge base
- SEO

## Technical details

Built with [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith). Hosted on GitHub Pages. Search powered by a small node app running on Heroku.

## Format

Each article (page) in the knowledge base has sections and FAQs. The sections are cut-and-dry "here's how to use X". The FAQs are more specific questions that we can answer. Sections and FAQs are separated by a `---` in the markdown file.

The directory structure is:

`[App Name]/[Section]/[Article].md`

for example:

`screendoor/responses/importing_responses.md`

## Development

You'll need [node](https://nodejs.org), [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io) installed.

1. `script/bootstrap`
2. Run the preview server: `wintersmith preview`
3. If you need to run the express-based search indexer: `npm start` or `nodemon search/index.coffee` (the latter will monitor for file changes and reload the server automatically)

## Testing

Run `grunt linkChecker:dev` to check the knowledge base for broken links.
